### UIImage

#####+ (UIImage *)imageNamed:(NSString *)fileName

If displaying a bundle image only once, it is recommended to use `+ (UIImage *)imageWithContentsOfFile:(NSString *)path` instead so as not to have the system cache the image. Per Apple documentation:
> If you have an image file that will only be displayed once and wish to ensure that it does not get added to the systemâ€™s cache, you should instead create your image using imageWithContentsOfFile:. This will keep your single-use image out of the system image cache, potentially improving the memory use characteristics of your app.

### UIView

#####@property(nonatomic) CGRect frame

When setting the frame property of a `UIView` item, it is valuable to ensure that the coordinates correspond to pixel locations, otherwise anti-aliasing will occur, reducing performance and potentially causing blurry edges in your interface. One straightforward solution is to use `CGRectIntegral()` to automatically round the `CGRect` values to the nearest point. For screens with a higher pixel density than 1 pixel per point, the coordinates only need to be rounded to the nearest `1.0f / screen.scale`
