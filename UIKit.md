### UIImage

#####+ (UIImage *)imageNamed:(NSString *)fileName

If displaying a bundle image only once, it is recommended to use `+ (UIImage *)imageWithContentsOfFile:(NSString *)path` instead so as not to have the system cache the image. Per Apple documentation:
> If you have an image file that will only be displayed once and wish to ensure that it does not get added to the systemâ€™s cache, you should instead create your image using imageWithContentsOfFile:. This will keep your single-use image out of the system image cache, potentially improving the memory use characteristics of your app.
